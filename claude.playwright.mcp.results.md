   items)
  - Navigation: Breadcrumb showing "home"
  - Product Grid: Three products displayed:
    a. Classic Tee - $19.99 - "soft cotton tee with a timeless fit"
    b. Hoodie - $49.99 - "cozy fleece-lined hoodie for everyday wear"
    c. Cap - $14.99 - "adjustable cap, breathable and light"

  Each product has an image, title, description, price, and "add to cart"
  button. The site appears to be fully functional with proper navigation
  links and cart functionality.

     … +48 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! The minus button worked exactly as expected for item removal:

  - The cap was completely removed from the cart (quantity went from 1 to
  0, so item disappeared)
  - Cart counter updated from 3 to 2 items
  - Subtotal updated from $114.97 to $99.98 (now just 2 hoodies)

⏺ Cart Functionality Test Results

  The e-commerce site's cart functionality works very well overall! Here's
  what I found:

  ✅ Working Features:
  - Add to Cart: Successfully added Hoodie and Cap (2/3 items worked)
  - Cart Counter: Updates correctly in header (0→1→2→3→2→0→1)
  - Cart Page: Displays items with images, names, prices, and quantities
  - Quantity Controls: + and - buttons work perfectly
  - Item Removal: Items are removed when quantity reaches 0
  - Clear Cart: Empties entire cart and shows "empty cart" message
  - Checkout Flow: Navigates to checkout page with demo message
  - Price Calculations: Subtotals update correctly with quantity changes
  - Navigation: All links and breadcrumbs work properly

  ❌ Issue Found:
  - Classic Tee: Adding this item fails with a 500 Internal Server Error
  - The cart API has an issue specifically with the Classic Tee (SKU-1)

  User Experience:
  - The interface is clean and intuitive
  - Real-time updates provide good feedback
  - Navigation flows logically between pages
  - Error handling could be improved (500 error isn't user-friendly)

  The cart functionality is robust and user-friendly, with only one item
  causing API errors that would need backend investigation.
