Navigate to localhost:3000 and abuse the cart funcitoanlity and look for weakneses, try to break the page

⏺ I'll help you test the cart functionality on localhost:3000 to identify potential vulnerabilities. Let me create a plan for this security testing.

⏺ Great! I can see the e-commerce site with products and a cart that already has 4 items. Let me first check the current cart
  contents and then start testing the cart functionality.

⏺ playwright - Click (MCP)(element: "cart link with 4 items", ref: "e5")
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                
     ```js
     await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'cart' }).click();
     … +62 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I can see the cart has 2 different products: 3 hoodies at $49.99 each and 1 classic tee at $19.99. Now let me test various
   vulnerabilities. Let me start with basic operations and then move to more advanced attacks.

  playwright - Click (MCP)(element: "plus button for hoodie quantity", ref: "e66")
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                       
     ```js
     await page.getByRole('button', { name: '+' }).first().click();
     … +58 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Good! The basic functionality works - cart count increased from 4 to 5 items, and the subtotal updated correctly. Now let me test
  for quantity manipulation vulnerabilities by trying to directly edit the quantity input field.

     await page.getByRole('listitem').filter({ hasText: 'hoodie$49.99-+$' }).getByRole('spinbutton').click();
     … +58 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me try to manipulate the quantity by typing a very large number or negative number to see if there are any validation
  issues:

  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                                                                        
     ```js
     await page.getByRole('listitem').filter({ hasText: 'hoodie$49.99-+$' }).getByRole('spinbutton').fill('999999');
     … +1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ playwright - Press a key (MCP)(key: "Enter")
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code       
     ```js
     // Press Enter
     … +65 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ 🚨 CRITICAL VULNERABILITY FOUND!

  The cart accepts extremely large quantities (999,999) without any validation, resulting in:
  - Cart total of nearly $50 million
  - Cart item count shows 1,000,000 in the header
  - No validation or limits on quantity input

  Let me test negative numbers:

  playwright - Type text (MCP)(element: "quantity spinbutton for hoodie", ref: "e65", text: "-100")
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                                                                      
     ```js
     await page.getByRole('listitem').filter({ hasText: 'hoodie$49.99-+$' }).getByRole('spinbutton').fill('-100');
     … +1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ playwright - Press a key (MCP)(key: "Enter")
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code       
     ```js
     // Press Enter
     … +49 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Interesting! When I entered -100, the hoodie item was completely removed from the cart. This suggests that negative quantities
  cause items to be removed, which could be exploited maliciously.

  Now let me test decimal values and special characters:

  playwright - Type text (MCP)(element: "quantity spinbutton for classic tee", ref: "e75", text: "1.5")
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code

  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code

⏺ The decimal value was rounded down to 1. Now let me test with XSS payloads:

⏺ Excellent! I can see the cart data structure. The price is stored in cents (1999 = $19.99). Now let me try to manipulate the cart
  data directly via the API:

⏺ Security Testing Summary

  After thoroughly testing the cart functionality on localhost:3000, I found several critical vulnerabilities:

  🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES:

  1. Quantity Manipulation Vulnerability - The most serious issue:
    - Cart accepts extremely large quantities (999,999) without validation
    - This resulted in a cart total of nearly $50 million
    - No upper limits or sanity checks on quantity inputs
    - Could cause integer overflow, DoS attacks, or processing issues
  2. Negative Quantity Behavior:
    - Entering negative quantities (-100) completely removes items from cart
    - Could be exploited to manipulate cart contents unexpectedly
  3. Missing CSRF Protection:
    - No CSRF tokens found in forms or API calls
    - Could be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks

  ✅ POSITIVE SECURITY MEASURES:

  1. Input Type Protection: XSS attempts were blocked on number inputs
  2. URL Parameter Sanitization: XSS attempts in URLs were properly encoded
  3. API Validation: Direct API manipulation with invalid data was rejected with 400 errors
  4. Checkout Flow Protection: Unauthorized step access was handled properly
  5. Session Persistence: Cart state maintained across tabs (expected behavior)

  🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES:

  1. Immediate: Implement quantity validation with reasonable upper limits (e.g., max 99)
  2. Immediate: Add minimum quantity validation (prevent negative values)
  3. High Priority: Implement CSRF tokens for API endpoints
  4. Medium: Add rate limiting to prevent rapid-fire cart additions
  5. Low: Consider adding client-side warnings for large quantities

  The quantity manipulation vulnerability poses the highest risk and should be addressed immediately as it could impact business
  operations and system stability.
